# My Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website showcasing my projects and skills, built using a downloaded template for the front-end and a custom Java back-end.

## Project Overview

- **Front-end**: The website is built using a customizable template.
- **Back-end**: The back-end is implemented using Java to handle dynamic content, form submissions, and other server-side functionality.
- **Deployment**: The front-end will be deployed using GitHub Pages, while the back-end will be handled using Java server technologies (such as Spring Boot or Servlets).

## Features

- Display of portfolio projects
- About Me section
- Contact form (handled by Java back-end)
- Skills and technologies section

## Technologies

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (from the downloaded template)
- **Back-end**: Java (Spring Boot, Servlets, or plain Java)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (front-end) and [your choice of Java server] (back-end)

## How to Set Up

### Front-end
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git
    cd your-portfolio
    ```

2. Download the front-end template and replace the files in the `frontend/` directory.

3. Customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to suit your personal brand and portfolio needs.

4. Deploy the front-end using GitHub Pages:
   - Go to the repository's settings.
   - Scroll down to **GitHub Pages** and select the branch for deployment.

### Back-end
1. Set up the Java back-end:
   - Install necessary Java dependencies, such as Spring Boot or Java Servlet API.
   - Create backend logic to handle dynamic content and form submissions.

2. Deploy the back-end on a server of your choice (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or your own VPS).
